## Background
Many publishers use categories as a means to logically organize their content. However, many pieces of content have more than one category. Sometimes it’s useful to designate a primary category for posts (and custom post types). On the front-end, we need the ability to query for posts (and custom post types) based on their primary categories.

## Your Mission
Create a WordPress plugin that allows publishers to designate a primary category for posts. We’ve intentionally left implementation details out so you have a chance to show us strategic thinking. The code you write should be secure and performant. When you’re done, send us the code as an archive or a link to a repository.

## Installation 
To install the plugin you can 
* Download this repo as a .zip file and upload it on your WordPress website
* Upload the whole `primary-category` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress website
